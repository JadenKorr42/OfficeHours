NOTES:
working on trigger system, also need to work on scrolling up and down. doors seem to be working,
	but instead of switching worlds you move to a different section on map.

TODO:
	-improve rendering speed.
	-decouple updating from rendering, though at this point any decent system will run at the desired speed, with older systems
		running a tad bit slower. (not gamebreaking though)
	-improve variety of blocks.
	-customize the main characters animations, as well as appearence.
	-add enemies, with basic movement/attack mechanisms.
	-add projectile.
	-add npc's with dialoque.
	-dramatically expand map, add themes to the different sectors.
		NOTE: improve rendering speed and performance first.




-NEED TO CREATE OWN TILESET, dont leave placeholders.
